# TTS Web - Claude Instructions

## Project Overview
Browser-based Text-to-Speech application using Piper TTS via WebAssembly. Fully client-side with no backend required.

## Code Standards

### Formatting
- Remove all trailing whitespace
- Use 2-space indentation
- Use single quotes for strings (except JSX attributes)
- No semicolons (consistent with existing code style)

### Git Commits
- Format: `type: description` (e.g., `fix: resolve audio concatenation issue`)
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `chore`
- No "Claude Code" or AI attribution in commit messages
- Keep messages concise and descriptive

### React/JavaScript Patterns
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Extract business logic into separate utility files
- Keep components focused on UI rendering
- Use custom hooks for complex state logic
- Prefer named exports for utilities

### File Organization
```
src/
├── components/     # React components
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── services/       # Business logic (API calls, TTS operations)
├── utils/          # Pure utility functions
├── config/         # Configuration constants
└── styles/         # CSS files
```

### Error Handling
- Always provide user-friendly error messages
- Log technical details to console
- Show error state in UI with recovery options
- Validate inputs before processing

### Performance
- Cache downloaded models using Cache API
- Persist model metadata in localStorage
- Process text in chunks to avoid blocking
- Show progress for long-running operations

## Important Technical Notes

### WebAssembly Requirements
- CORS headers are critical in vite.config.js
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
- These enable SharedArrayBuffer for WASM

### Audio Processing
- Text is chunked at 500 characters respecting sentence boundaries
- Multiple audio chunks should be concatenated or played sequentially
- Use Web Audio API for concatenation when possible

### Model Management
- Models downloaded from HuggingFace are cached in browser
- Track downloaded models in localStorage for persistence
- Verify cache integrity on app load

## When Editing Files
- Always edit existing files rather than creating new ones
- Read the file first before making changes
- Maintain existing code style and patterns
- Test changes don't break CORS or WASM functionality
