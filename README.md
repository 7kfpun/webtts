# TTS Web

A browser-based Text-to-Speech application powered by [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) running entirely client-side via WebAssembly. No backend server required.

## Features

- 🌍 **Multi-language Support** - Access hundreds of voices across dozens of languages
- 🎯 **High-Quality Speech** - Natural-sounding voices with multiple quality levels
- 💾 **Offline Capable** - Download models once, use them offline indefinitely
- 🚀 **Fast Processing** - WebAssembly-powered TTS runs locally in your browser
- 📦 **No Backend Required** - Fully client-side application
- 🔊 **Smart Text Chunking** - Handles long texts by intelligently splitting at sentence boundaries
- 📊 **Progress Tracking** - Real-time progress for downloads and generation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to use the application.

## How It Works

1. **Select Language & Voice** - Choose from available languages and voices
2. **Download Model** - Download the TTS model (one-time, cached in browser)
3. **Enter Text** - Type or paste the text you want to convert to speech
4. **Generate** - Click "Speak" to generate audio
5. **Listen** - Play the generated audio directly in your browser

```

## Technical Details

### WebAssembly & CORS

The application requires specific CORS headers to enable SharedArrayBuffer for WebAssembly:

```javascript
headers: {
  'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',
  'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
}
```

### Model Caching

- TTS models are fetched from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices)
- Downloaded models are cached using the browser's Cache API
- Model metadata persists in localStorage for tracking
- Models remain available offline after initial download

### Text Processing

- Text is split into chunks (max 1000 characters)
- Chunking respects paragraph and sentence boundaries
- Each chunk is processed separately to avoid blocking
- Audio chunks are concatenated for seamless playback

## Dependencies

### Runtime

- **React 19** - UI framework
- **piper-wasm** - Piper TTS WebAssembly bindings

### Build Tools

- **Vite 7** - Build tool and dev server
- **ESLint** - Code linting

## Browser Support

Requires a modern browser with:

- WebAssembly support
- SharedArrayBuffer support
- Cache API support
- Web Audio API support

Tested on:

- Chrome/Edge 92+
- Firefox 92+
- Safari 15.2+

## Development

### Code Style

- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Functional React components with hooks
- Clean architecture with separated concerns

### Commit Convention

```
type: description

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore
Example: fix: resolve audio concatenation issue
```

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server with hot reload
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

## Troubleshooting

### Audio not playing

- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure dev server is running with correct headers
- Verify model was downloaded successfully

### Model download fails

- Check internet connection
- Verify HuggingFace is accessible
- Clear browser cache and retry

### Performance issues

- Reduce text length or split into smaller chunks
- Use lower quality models for faster processing
- Close other browser tabs to free memory

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style
2. Test thoroughly in multiple browsers
3. Update documentation for new features
4. Use conventional commit messages
